\chapter{Crosstalk Experiments}
\label{chap:experiments}
In this section we discuss the details of thorough experiments that we conducted in order to quantify how the crosstalk affects the perceived depth. For the sake of completeness, we performed various experiments on considerably complex (realistic looking) rendered images that consisted of stimuli of various widths and geometric complexities. The effect of crosstalk were observed for both stereoscopic and automultiscopic displays.

\section{Motivation}
Even though previously some work has been done by Tsirlin \cite{tsirlin2011effect}\cite{tsirlin2012crosstalk}\cite{tsirlin2012effect} in order to understand these effects, we \textcolor{red}{felt that the experiments were incomplete and needed some more thorough investigation.}. The reason for that is that firstly Tsirlin's experiments were performed on monochromatic images where no other depth cue other than disparity was present. As mentioned in chapter 3, we conducted such a pilot experiment on ourselves (the author and one colleague) with a thin rectangular white bar on a black background using a similar Wheatstone setup and found that it took some getting used to to sense any depth of the stimulus even at high disparities. Even after spending some time on it, it was extremely hard and unreliable to guess the apparent distance of the stimulus from the screen in length units. This would mean that the naive test subjects would also have encountered the same problems. This observation is backed by the fact that the test subjects in \cite{tsirlin2012effect} and \cite{tsirlin2011effect} reported reduced depth of the stimuli even when no crosstalk was present. More reliable experiments would be ones where the test subjects report the actual theoretical depth in the base case i.e. when no crosstalk is present. Coupled with the fact that the test subjects were simply asked to report the perceived depth via a sliding bar representing zero or some maximum depth at extremes of the bar, it is likely that generated results could have been unreliable. The scenes of the natural world usually have at least some other monocular cues e.g. proper light shading, texture gradients and defocus blur etc. Moreover, since one factor contributing to visibility of the ghosts is also how much it is separated from the object, wide objects at some disparity will exhibit less visible ghosting than thin stimuli.

It is commonly believed that the reason for degraded observed depth in the presence of crosstalk is due to the fact that the human visual system is confused in choosing the correct location (or disparity) of the correct match for an object in the corresponding binocular retinal image. To the best of our knowledge, it is yet unclear whether this HVS confusion is elevated or reduced when the geometric complexity of the object (stimulus) is increased.  Which is why we thought it would be important to understand the relation of crosstalk on observed depth on stimuli of different widths and geometric complexities. Current studies suggests that for a certain crosstalk level and considerably smaller width of a desperate object, the extent of observed depth degradation increases as the disparity increase. This sounds counter-intuitive because for substantially high disparity of a thin object, the ghost will be completely separated and far away from the actual object itself. If the reason for degraded depth is actually the confusion of HVS in finding the proper match, then in such case the HVS should be able to find the proper match relatively easily because it is easy to distinguish between the ghost and the object as compared to the case of overlapping ghost. We hypothesized that the observed depth of any object with respect to the actual theoretical depth should degrade as long as some part of the ghost overlaps the object itself and the observed depth should improve when the ghost completely separates. Hence the graphs of figure \ref{fig:tsirlin_res} should be \say{U shaped}.

In stereoscopic displays, the arrangement of object-ghost pair is antisymmetric between the eyes \textcolor{red}{maybe make a diagram for this from the notebook}. This however is not the case with automultiscopic display. As seen in figure \ref{fig:gaussians}, at least two of the neighboring views are responsible for adding crosstalk at any view point. Also, at the sweet spots, the number of views involved in light leakage from the left is always equal to the number of light leaking views from the right. Because the automultiscopic display displays light fields, the arrangement of object-ghost tuple is symmetric in both eyes (at sweet spots). The HVS might react differently to this major difference. Again, to the best of our knowledge, until now there have been no studies that observed the effect of crosstalk on perceived depth in automultiscopic displays.\pagebreak

\section{stimuli}
Our stimuli consisted of an object (cylinder or a dragon) placed in front of a plane that had a light wooded texture. The reason for choosing a textured background was the HVS's efficiency in distinguishing between textures. This would make it easy for the observer to correctly guess the distance between the background and the foreground object. In order to make sure that our stimuli contains most of the basic monocular cues, we properly rendered them on computer using blender 2.73.
The blender scene as shown in figure \ref{fig:blender_scene} consisted of a an object of interest placed at origin. The background plane with wooden texture was placed 3 meters (world units) behind the object parallel to the camera plane. In order to capture the shading effects on the object, the scene was lit with a light source (sun) that was placed 10 meters in front and 3 meters at height of the object. Finally the camera was 10 meters in front of the object. The stereo scene was generated by capturing the two images at some distance on each side parallel to the image plane. This distance represented the baseline of the cameras.

Our experiments were based on test subjects judging the observed distance between the cylinder and the textured plane. This could have been achieved by either moving the cylinder or by moving the background plane in space relative to the camera. This however would have changed the object or the texture size which could have been used as a cue by the observers. In order to avoid that, we simply generated a dense series of images with varying camera baselines and keeping the position of the background plane in lock with respect to the camera. This way, the background was always at zero disparity (i.e. the plane of focus) and the cylinder always had a crossed disparity meaning the cylinder always appeared to be in front of the plane by some distance. In order to avoid resizing, images were rendered at the resolution of 768x432. With the smallest baseline, the observed distance between the cylinder and the plane was negligible where as this distance appeared to be increasing as the baseline increased all while keeping the size of object, size of texture and the proximity of the object to the texture constant. For the objects we chose four cylinders of different radii and a dragon from Stanford's 3D scanning repository. The details of each of those objects can be found in table \ref{tab:stimili_desc}.

\subsection{Stereo and Automultiscopic stimuli}
For the stereo experiments, captured the scene with the camera baseline starting from 0.002 meters till 0.12 meters with the step of 0.002 meters. This gave us sixty sets of stereo images where the theoretical depth of the object of interest ranged from 0.04 cm to 3.45 cm (0-10.5 arc mins in terms of crossed disparity) in front of the plane of focus. Figure \ref{fig:stimuli_stereo} shows stereo images of one of the cylinder and the dragon. The step size was chosen small enough so that the transition from the minimum to the maximum depth for an object would seem continues to the observer.

\end{figure}

The images for automultiscopic experiments were rendered similarly. The only difference being that the range of baseline started from 0 until 0.24 meters. The reason for this is explained in the next section.

\section{Apparatus and simulation procedure}
The experiments were conducted on a commercial 47'' SIMS2 HDR47E LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080. The left and right half of the screen each with a resolution of 960x1080 were gated to the left and right eye using a custom built Wheatstone setup \cite{ wiki:wheatstone} that consisted of two mirrors M1 and M2 set at $45^\circ$ angle with respect to the screen. The optical length from the eyes to the screen via mirrors M1 and M2 was measured at 87.3 cm. The whole setup was enclosed in a black box with an aperture through which the viewer could view the screen via mirrors M1. The display even though build for HDR viewing had a DVI plus mode for which the luminance measured with luminance meter via the aperture ranged from \textcolor{red}{?? to ??} $cdm^{-2}$. The DVI plus mode should (according to the documentation) mimic the traditional LCD display hence we chose to use this mode.

\end{figure}

Since on an LCD panel, all the rgb channels equally and additively contribute to the crosstalk, we simulated the ghosted images simple by adding a percentage image of unintended view to the intended view image. For stereo, simple addition of a percentage of the right image into the left and vice versa sufficed. However, the automultiscopic case was a little tricky. First of all we simulated the view intensity profiles in figure \ref{fig:gaussians} using Gaussians with $\sigma = 2$ and means located at the sweet spots of the automultiscopic displays (figure \ref{fig:sim_gaussians}). To match the profiles in figure \ref{fig:gaussians}, the gaussians were upscaled such that the value 0.8 was attained at the mean. Using our simulated profiles, we found that at any sweet spot viewing position, the amount of light leaked from views other then the two adjacent views was negligible. Hence in our simulation we only considered light leakage from the adjacent views. Considering that an automultiscopic screen displays light fields sampled at frequency $1/\delta_x$ ($\delta_x$ being the step size at which the images were captured along the camera baseline), the leaked light from a position `y' to position `x' can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
l(y,x) \simeq a_y(x)\:.\:f(y)
\label{eq:ct_leak_eq}
\end{equation}
Where $a_y(x)$ is the Gaussian(corresponding to location y) value at position `x' and $f(y)$ is the light field image at position `y'. And the observe image \say{g} at any viewing position `x' can be mathematically modeled as
\begin{equation}
g(x) \: \simeq \: ...\: +\: l(x-2\delta_x,\:x)\:+\: l(x-\delta_x,\:x)\:+\:l(x,\:x)\:+\: l(x+2\delta_x,\:x)\:+\: l(x+\delta_x,\:x)\:+ \:...
\label{eq:ct_sim_eq}
\end{equation}
This would mean that the amount of ghost separation at any disparity of the object would be constant on either side. In order to keep the nature of the automultiscopic experiments similar to that of the stereo (where the ghost separation increase as the disparity increase), we changed the sampling rate $\delta_x$ with respect to the disparity of the object.

i.e. For a disparity `2.d', the observed left and right images can be written as

\begin{aligned}

\section{Experiment procedure}
\subsection{Environment Setup}
For our experiments, we subdivided the screen horizontally, the upper half where the test subjects would see the crosstalk added scene(stimuli) with some fixed depth of the object, and the lower half where the subjects were shown the same scene without any crosstalk. We will refer to the upper half of the screen as reference stimulus and the lower half as test stimulus. Also we will call the depth difference between the background (wooden plane at zero disparity) and the foreground object (at some crossed disparity) the depth of the object. As mentioned in section 4.2, the depths of the object in the presented stimuli ranged from 0.04 to 3.45 centimeters. The subjects could vary the depth in the test stimulus in the above mentioned range via left and right mouse buttons. Due to the dense sampling of the light field (small baseline distance change), the change in the depth appeared continuous, i.e. the viewers could not observe any jumps while changing it. Pressing the left mouse button for 6 seconds would change the depth of the object from 0.04 cm to 3.45 cm, and vice versa for the right click. During the experiment, the subjects were tasked with matching the depth in the test stimulus to the observed depth of the reference. Upon matching the depth, the subjects would register the answer using the center mouse click. Figure \ref{fig:exp_env} shows the overall layout of the screen from a viewer's perspective. To avoid the possibility of the subject matching the absolute depths of the objects rather than the depth difference between the background plane and the object, as required, we shifted the depth of the reference stimulus by 3.45 cm towards the viewer whereas the depth of the test stimulus was shift equally away from the viewer. Thus ensuring that the depths of the objects would never coincide, and hence the subjects would not be able to match the absolute object's depth. In addition, a nonious cross-hair representing the plane of focus was added at the bottom center of the screen. Figure \ref{fig:exp_env_depth} shows the top view of the visualized environment. The experiment environment was created using Psychtoolbox-3 package for Matlab.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Subjects}
Several paid test subjects and the author participated in the experiments. In order to ensure the subject's correctness of the stereo vision, they were first asked to identify the proximity of the test and reference stimuli with respect to the cross-hair. Also they were asked to identify the polarity of the change in depth of the test stimulus while the author changed it slightly in each direction. Table \ref{tab:agg_subj} shows the number of participants in each kind of experiments.

\end{table}

\subsection{Experiment parameters}
Four levels of crosstalk i.e. 0\%, 3\%, 7\% and 14\% and seven levels of depths (crossed disparity) i.e. 0.04, 0.73, 1.18, 1.53, 1.75, 2.76 and 3.44 centimeters were chosen to be tested. We neglected any level of crosstalk greater than 14\% because in our pilot experiments we noticed that any greater crosstalk level almost always resulted in matching of the stimulus with the ghost resulting in total loss of depth. We couldn't find any commercial stereo display where the crosstalk levels were that high. Usually they are below 10\%. During the experiment, each subject was asked to match the observed depths for all possible combinations i.e 28 trials (4 crosstalk levels $\times$ 7 depth levels) in total for each kind of stimulus. Trials for stereoscopic and automultiscopic cases were conducted separately.
\\
\section{Results}

In the following section, median data for all the observers along with the standard error for each crosstalk level (figure \ref{fig:s_crosstalk_0} to ??) are shown. Individual lines in the graphs denote the different objects i.e. cylinders of all widths and the dragon as mentioned in table \ref{tab:stimili_desc}. The axis defines the actual and the observed theoretical disparity-defined depths. Ideally, all the graphs should be diagonally coinciding lines indicating no effect of crosstalk on perceived depth. Even though generally it is not the case, it can be observed that in the base case (no crosstalk), all the graphs (for all objects) almost approximates a diagonal line for both stereo and automultiscopic experiments. This is an improvement over \cite{tsirlin2012effect} meaning that the reported amounts of depth degradation for different cases would be more reliable.

\subsection{Stereo}
It can be seen in figure \ref{fig:s_crosstalk_0} that in absence of crosstalk, the observers mostly perceived the depths correctly. A slight overestimation of depth in case of the smallest depth (0.04 cm) can be seen for the thickest cylinder (width = 36 arc min). Given the fact that the user controlled depth variation of test stimulus was continuous, it is reasonable to assume that it would be quite unlikely for the observers to exactly match the depths. Hence the slight overestimation of depth can be considered as an observer approximation error. The same however could not be straightforwardly said about the underestimation for the dragon at 2.76 cm depth which is mapped to approximately 2 cm observed depth. But since the next greater depth shows no underestimation, we can safely assume it to be a \textcolor{red}{human error}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Template_Figures/s_crosstalk_0}
    \caption{Abscissa shows the observed depth when no crosstalk is present. The error bars indicate $\pm$ 1 standard error.\label{fig:s_crosstalk_0}}
\end{figure}

When the crosstalk is increased to 3\% (figure \ref{fig:s_crosstalk_3}), it is clear that the observed depth of thin(18.9 arc min) cylinder starts degrading at depths greater than 1.75 cm. The angular disparity at this depth is 5.35 arc min which would give the ghost separation of 28\%. A slight overestimation of the 2.76 cm depth for cylinder (75.6 arc min) can be considered as approximation error. The reason for this again is that the next greater depth is observed without any degradation. We think it would be reasonable to consider this as a human approximation error because the HVS probably does not gets confused for some disparity and then behaves without any error for the following larger disparities. I.e. once the observed depth starts degrading at some disparity, provided all the other conditions are kept constant, it should keep on degrading for all larger disparities as well.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Template_Figures/s_crosstalk_3}
    \caption{Abscissa shows the observed depth when 3\% crosstalk is present. The error bars indicate $\pm$ 1 standard error.\label{fig:s_crosstalk_3}}
\end{figure}

Substantial effects on the observed depth starts appearing once the crosstalk level is increased to 7\% \ref{fig:s_crosstalk_7}. The cylinders of all widths show reduced observed depth. The reduction is most severe for the thin (18.9 arc min) cylinder. The loss of observed depth appears to be lower as the width of the cylinder increases while the observed depth of the dragon seems to be unaffected. One interesting point to observe is that for all the cylinders, the perceived depth starts degrading at the actual depths of 1.75 cm or higher. For the thin cylinder, the ghost is completely separated only at the maximum i.e. 10.5 disparity arc min. However the observed depth appears to be the same for the maximum and the second maximum i.e. 8.4 arc min disparity. Also it should be noted that the graph for the thin cylinder shows signs of degradation even at actual depth of 1.13 cm.  The ghost separation at this point is ??\textcolor{red}{why also make a table of ghost separation}

Observed depth is severely affected for all the object once the crosstalk reaches 14\% \ref{fig:s_crosstalk_14}. The thin cylinder again shows signs of degradation starting at the actual depth of 1.13 cm where as the observed depths of all the other objects starts deteriorating at the theoretical depth of 1.76 cm. The pattern of wider objects showing less depth deterioration compared to thin objects is still observed. However, with such extreme crosstalk level, even the observed depth of the dragon is reported to be substantially affected.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Automultiscopic}


Figure \ref{fig:a_crosstalk_0} shows the patter of the observed depth in the base case. It appears that the observed depth for the dragon is slightly overestimated at the actual depth of 2.76 cm. At the same instance, the observed depth of the thick cylinder is underestimated. These exceptional cases can be considered as a \textcolor{red}{human error} firstly because the next greater depth is observed without any error and secondly because this case is exactly the same as the base case of the stereo experiments.

We notice that the crosstalk has no effect on the perceived depth when the crosstalk level is raised to 3\% (figure \ref{fig:a_crosstalk_3}). This is because for each of the perceived depth, the base case observed depth is in the rage of the standard error \textcolor{red}{refer to the residual}. This is different than the stereoscopic scenario where we observed some minute depth reduction for the thin cylinder. Increasing the crosstalk to 7\% (figure \ref{fig:a_crosstalk_7}) however shows signs of degraded depth for the medium (37.8 arc min) cylinder at actual depths of 2.76 and 3.44 cm. Meanwhile all the other object show no evidence of degraded depth even though the crosstalk level at 7\% is higher than what we usually get from a conventional automultiscopic display \cite{woods2012crosstalk}.

\end{figure}
Interestingly, increasing the crosstalk level to 14\% also shows that for all objects (except medium cylinder) the perceived depth is not different than the depth observed in absence of crosstalk \textcolor{red}{refer to the residual plot}. It is not clear why only the medium cylinder shows depth degradation in this case. However, based on the results it is clear that the effect of crosstalk on the perceived depth is significantly lower (or negligible) in the automultiscopic environment. Possible explanations for all these behaviors can be found in the next section.

\section {Discussion}
\subsection{Stereo}
%Explain what we have observed?
In these experiments, we found that that for the stereoscopic case, crosstalk has a substantial degrading effect on the magnitude of perceived depth. I.e. the perceived depth magnitude relative to the 0\% crosstalk base case deceases as the crosstalk level increase. Moreover, for a fixed value of crosstalk, the degradation effect seems to be more pronounced as the disparity increases. This effect is stronger on the thin objects as compared to the wider ones. One of our initial hypothesis suggesting that the perceived depth magnitude might not be degraded once the ghost and the object separates completely was also proven to be wrong as the results clearly shows degradation even in the those cases. In order to justify these results, we have to delve into the theories regarding how the HVS extracts depth from disparity.

There is evidence to suggest that the HVS uses the cross-correlation between horizontally displaced patches on the two retinal images to obtain the disparity of objects.\cite{filippini2009limits}\cite{kane2014limits}. The disparity, once the cross-correlation is performed is extracted by locating the peaks in the resultant correlation profiles \cite{cormack1991interocular}. It is easy for the HVS to identify sharp clear peaks compared to broad noisy ones as shown in figure \ref{fig:cormack}. Since adding crosstalk additively to an image effectively reduce the global contrast and severely reduces the local contrast around object, it is obvious that HVS will have difficulty in resolving the proper disparity hence the depth degradation. Also it is believed that the patches chosen for inter-ocular cross-correlation are two dimensional isotropic Gaussians\cite{filippini2009limits} called the Gaussian windows. It is not clear what the size (constant or variable) of those windows is.

If the HVS could somehow match the patch containing the ghost-object pair in one retinal image to the other, then according to windowed cross-correlation theory disparity computed would either be zero or the actual disparity without any degradation. However, we think that the HVS in case of stereo only uses the object-containing patch in one retinal image to obtain the horizontal disparity based on correlation with the other image. One of the reason for this is that HVS has a certain limitation and it can not fuse two objects together if the disparity gradient (defined as the ratio of disparity difference between two objects and their cyclopean angular separation) is greater than 1-1.5 \cite{howard1995binocular} \cite{kane2014limits}. In case of stereo where the objects in both images has a crossed disparity, their ghosts have an uncrossed and equal disparity relative to the plane of focus. This in terms of geometry is only possible if the ghost is located exactly behind the object (similar to the double nail illusion as illustrated in \cite{tsirlin2012effect} \cite{krol1980double}) making the disparity gradient $\infty$. In such cases, the stimulus with higher luminance (the actual object)is fused leaving the ghost in diplopic state. The other reason is that the HVS also takes into consideration the polarity of the luminance changes between patches in order to find a correct match. This means that an object who's left side is black and right side is white will not be matched to the object in the other retinal image who's left side is white and right side is black \cite{howard1995binocular}. In case of stereoscopy with added crosstalk, the polarity of the ghost-object luminance change in one retinal image is the opposite of the other. Hence it is reasonable to assume that a patch that only contains the object of interest from one retinal image is chosen to compute the horizontal interocular cross-correlation with the other. We tried simulating the disparity estimation via interocular cross-correlation using the model proposed in \cite{filippini2009limits} and found that the crosstalk had no effect of the computed disparity.

For the x, y position of an object in one of the stereo image, the ghost in the other image is present at the exact same location while the actual object is located at some horizontal disparity `d'. Computing the cross-correlation in this case would result in two peaks i.e one at zero disparity and the other at disparity `d'. Hence the HVS might apply some averaging in order to obtain a disparity. This however is only possible when the disparity is large enough to separate the ghost from the object completely. As seen in figure \ref{fig:normal_ccr}, this is not the case when the ghost is not fully separated from the object. In this case the correlation will result in one peak. Considering the correlation profile, we observe that there is difference between the slope around zero disparity (location of the ghost) and the actual disparity `d'. \textcolor{red}{??} performed experiments that suggested that the HVS also uses the first derivative of luminance in order to find matching portions of stereo images. In that case the HVS can still isolate two distinct peaks in the cross-correlation profile where one peak results at zero disparity due to ghost and the other at disparity `d'. Since the HVS gives preference to lower disparities \cite{krol1980double}, if the averaging is performed based on the heights and the distances (relative to the zero disparity) of the peaks, then this might explain the loss of perceived depth magnitude that is proportional to the crosstalk level. This would also explain why at some crosstalk level threshold (16\% in our experiments), the ghosts are matched to the original objects and the viewer perceive two copies of the object side by side (double nail illusion) located at the plane of focus. However, this will still not explain why wider objects result in lower loss of perceived depth magnitude as compared to the thin objects.

In our experiment results, we also noticed that the perceived depth magnitude remains unaffected for some small disparities even when the crosstalk level is at 14\%. For 3\% crosstalk, this threshold is the angular disparity of 5.25 arc min (1.75 cm depth) where as for the crosstalk level of 7\% and 14\% these thresholds seems to be 4.2 arc min (1.5 cm) and 3.15 arc min (1.18 cm). This suggests that the HVS probably does not average the disparities at locations of interocular cross-correlation peaks as that would have resulted in a degraded perceived depth at every disparity. Our proposed modified windows interocular cross-correlation model explained in chapter 5 might explain these results.

Our results are consistent with the current literature and shows a clear degrading effect on the perceived depth that increases with the increase of crosstalk level and the decrease of object's width. Kooi and Toet \cite{kooi2004visual} showed that as low as 5\% crosstalk can result in reduced visual comfort. Considering that and based on our results, we recommend that the crosstalk levels in stereoscopic 3D displays should not exceed more than 3\%. At this level we found that the perceived depth is not significantly degraded for all the objects. \pagebreak


\subsection{Automultiscopic}

Even though, at first impression it might seem like the crosstalk should have a greater effect on the observed depth in automultiscopic scenes for a simple reason that the number of ghosts per image are greater (one on each side of the object as opposed to only one ghost in case of stereo). Our results indicate that there was no substantial effect of crosstalk on the perceived depth magnitude in automulticopic environment. We believe that the HVS in case of automultiscopic environment matches the patches containing the tuple of left-ghost, object and right-ghost in one retinal image to the similarly appearing patch in the other one. One reason for this as mentioned in the previous section is that the HVS considers the polarity of luminance changes in the object. The tuples in both the retinal images have the same luminance profiles. The other reason is that matching the tuples containing patching in this way will not violate any disparity gradient which was the case with the ghosts in stereoscopic environment.

\begin{table}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Description of the of ghosts and objects seen in an automultiscopic environment according to equation \ref{eq:auto_obs_imgs}}
    \label{tab:ghost_obj_names}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \toprule
      Image & Stimulus  & Location(disparity)\\
      \midrule
                       & Left ghost & 0  \\
      Left Eye Image   & Object & $\frac{d}{2}$\\
                       & Right ghost & 2$\times$$\frac{d}{2}$\\
                       &             & \\
                       & Left ghost & 2$\times$$\frac{-d}{2}$  \\
      Right Eye Image  & Object & $\frac{d}{2}$\\
                       & Right ghost & 0\\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

It can be seen from table \ref{tab:ghost_obj_names} that the tuple in the left eye is located at a disparity `d' in the right eye image. And since matching tuple containing patches will not cause any confusion, it is clear why the viewers were able to report the proper depths (in most cases) for the objects despite of raising the crosstalk level to 14\%. Based on our results we can conclude that crosstalk does not have any significant effect on the observed depth in automultiscopic displays. However, since the number of ghosts are double the amount found in stereoscopic screens, we can predict that crosstalk in automultiscopic screen will affect the viewers visual comfort to a greater extent. Our experiments simulated only for the sweet spot of an automultiscopic screens. It should be noted that even though amount of light leakage from neighboring views will change as the viewer moves away from the sweet spot, the pattern of the luminance changes throughout the objects will remain the same. Hence the observed depths of the objects will not be affected. The observed geometry of the objects however might change (depending on the scene) due to crosstalk if the viewer is not located in the sweet spots.

Given the fact that the amount of crosstalk changes as the viewer moves his/her viewing position, and the fact that crosstalk might change the observed geometry of the objects in the scene while viewing from a non-sweet spot position, it is difficult to recommend a minimum level of crosstalk that ensures a pleasant and comfortable viewing experience. We know that as low as 5\% of crosstalk in a stereoscopic display is enough to result in visual discomfort. We can predict that this threshold would be much lower for an automultiscopic display. However, further research must be carried out in order to provide such objective measurements.
