\section{Summary}

\section{Future Work}
experiments with variable widths to see how the hvs coup with that.
experiments where the disparity gradiant between two objects is greater than 1. TO check if the ghost diplopia is really the factor causing the depth degradation or it can be any object.
mention the proposed optimizations for automultiscopic screens as well.
