Stereoscopic and automultiscopic displays suffer from crosstalk. An effect which greatly reduces image quality, viewer comfort and distort the perception of depth. Previously, only a limited work has been done on understanding the relation between crosstalk and the perceived depth with respect to the nature of the stimuli. Moreover most of the previous work is carried on simple monochromatic scenes. Since the human visual system uses numerous other cues than disparity to estimate the depth of an object in a stereo scene, monochromatic scenes are poor choice for understanding the above mentioned relation. In addition to that, the model for HVS depth resolution via disparity as provided by the current literature fails to justify why and how the perceived depth is affected by the crosstalk. In this work, we  perform improved and more generalized experiments to see how the depth perception is affected by the crosstalk for different kinds of stimuli. Based on the result of these experiments, we derive a modified model for human visual system's resolution of depth from disparity that takes the ghosting in consideration while estimating the viewer's observed depth of a stimuli. Finally some improved techniques for compensation of crosstalk in automultiscopic displays are proposed.
